# Ruby Recursion

This is my implementation of the [Recursion](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-recursion) project assigned in the [Computer Science](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby#a-bit-of-computer-science) section of the [Ruby](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby) course which is part of the [Full Stack Ruby on Rails](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails) curriculum from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

## Project Description

The main goal of this project was to implement two recursive functions:
* `fibs_rec` which returns the first `n` numbers of the fibonacci sequence in an array
* `merge_sort` which returns a sorted array of numbers
